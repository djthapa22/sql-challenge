# SQL-Challenge: Employee SQL Analysis

**Overview:**

In this Activity, I learned how to use PG Admin and PostGress in learning the following things within SQL, along with creating an ERD diagram to relate tables:

* Creating Tables with Columns
* Importing Data from CSV File
* Creating inner Joins to link two or more tables
*  Filtering and Grouping items to find a given criteria
* Using ERD to map out relations from given criteria amongst other tables
* Using Primary, Foreing key to set constraints

<ins> Output of ERD: </ins>
